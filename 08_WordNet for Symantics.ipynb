    "### Wordnet:-\n",
    "1. WordNet is a large lexical database of English. It groups English words into sets of cognitive synonyms, known as synsets, each of which expresses a distinct concept. \n",
    "2. Synsets are interlinked by means of conceptual-semantic and lexical relations. The resulting network of meaningfully related words and concepts can be navigated with the WordNet browser.\n",
    "3. WordNet interlinks not just word forms—strings of letters—but specific senses of words. As a result, words that are found in close proximity to one another in the network are semantically disambiguated. \n",
    "4. WordNet labels the semantic relations among words, whereas the groupings of words in a thesaurus do not follow any explicit pattern other than meaning similarity .\n",
    "5. In WordNet terminology, each group of synonyms is a synset, and a synonym that forms part of a synset is a lexical variant of the same concept. \n",
    "6. WordNet is primarily used in automatic text analysis and artificial intelligence applications. It was first created in the English language and the English WordNet database and software tools have been released under a BSD style license and are freely available for download from the WordNet website. There are now WordNets in more than 200 languages.\n",
    "7. WordNet can be seen as a combination and extension of a dictionary and thesaurus. It can be used as a lexical ontology in the computer science sense. \n",
    "\n",
    "***Conclusion*** :-WordNet is a powerful tool for semantic analysis in natural language processing. It provides a structured way to understand the semantic relationships between words, which can be used to improve the accuracy and effectiveness of NLP applications."
